#eBayProject

As a part of my 4th round interview at Shopping.com - division of eBay Inc , I created a simple iPhone app for browsing stock data stored in your Dropbox file accessible after a 2-step authentication -

####Instructions -

1) Open *eBayProject.xcodeprojec* in Xcode 5.0 or later

2) Build the project `Shift âŒ˜ R`

3) Enable [Two-step verification](https://www.dropbox.com/account#security) on your Dropbox

4) Login with your Dropbox credentials

####Possible Bug to be fixed -

When a `myebayproject` is created in your Dropbox drive, stocks.json file might not have synced. Please download [from here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lfp0qxjnrhsf9iy/stocks.json) to run the app. Donwload the JSON file and make sure it is placed in `myebayproject`.
